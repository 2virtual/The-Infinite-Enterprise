  <em>You werenâ€™t meant to just scale a brand.</em><br />
  You were wired to build something that echoes beyond your lifetime.<br />
  In a world chasing algorithms and viralityâ€¦<br />
  <strong>what you build can still be timeless.</strong>
  <br /><br />

  <strong>ðŸ“˜ What Youâ€™ll Discover:</strong><br />
  â€¢ How to scale like omnipresence â€” without burnout<br />
  â€¢ How to design systems that multiply without you<br />
  â€¢ How to build for legacy, not just launches<br />
  â€¢ How to use AI as a multiplier, not a replacement<br />
  â€¢ How to embed purpose, values, and structure that outlive you
  <br /><br />

  <strong>âœ… For Visionaries Who...</strong><br />
  â€¢ Feel called to create more than just content<br />
  â€¢ Want to lead without burning out<br />
  â€¢ Care about significance more than success<br />
  â€¢ Want to build something that survives them<br />
  â€¢ Believe their ideas can live forever â€” if built right
</Typography>

          move without you, and echo beyond your lifetime.
